#BlueStamp Engineering Project

Hi! My name is Derrick and I am going to be a junior at Lowell High School in the Fall. My Starter Project is the MiniPov and my main project is Home Automation with the Amazon Alexa.

I came to Bluestamp looking for a challenge and that is exactly what I got. I gained confidence and problem solving abilities and ways to workaround some software limitations. Guest speakers were interesting and provided a different point of view and perspective of what is to come.  I really like Bluestamp because it showed me how to work around problems and to keep pushing to find solutions.
