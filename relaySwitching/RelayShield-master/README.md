_The RelayShield library makes it easy to use the Photon RelayShield. It provides functions to turn relays on and off, all the relays on and off at the same time, and to check whether a relay is currently on or off._

## Examples

1. __Blink a Relay__ - Turning relays on and off, one at a time
2. __Control all Relays__ - Turning all the relays on and off
3. __Internet Relays__ - Setting up functions so you can call relays over the internet!
